> Expose stats and perform analytics on a node.
WARNING: This module is not safe to use in production due to possible privacy implications.

**Note:** This module uses [pull-streams](https://pull-stream.github.io) for all stream based interfaces.

### Why?

`libp2p` collects stats about existing connections, but those are not exposed and its not possible query those stats from the outside. This module allows doing just that by exposing them to other nodes to query. Note that right now there is no authentication and any node would be able to query stats from any other node.

## Install

```

## Usage

### Example


### This module uses `pull-streams`

We expose a streaming interface based on `pull-streams`, rather then on the Node.js core streams implementation (aka Node.js streams). `pull-streams` offers us a better mechanism for error handling and flow control guarantees. If you would like to know more about why we did this, see the discussion at this [issue](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/362).

- [pull-streams documentation](https://pull-stream.github.io/)

#### Converting `pull-streams` to Node.js Streams

If you are a Node.js streams user, you can convert a pull-stream to a Node.js stream using the module [`pull-stream-to-stream`](https://github.com/dominictarr/pull-stream-to-stream), giving you an instance of a Node.js stream that is linked to the pull-stream. For example:

```js
const pullToStream = require('pull-stream-to-stream')

const nodeStreamInstance = pullToStream(pullStreamInstance)
// nodeStreamInstance is an instance of a Node.js Stream
```

## Contribute

Contributions are welcome! The libp2p implementation in JavaScript is a work in progress. As such, there's a few things you can do right now to help out:

- [Check out the existing issues](//github.com/dryajov/js-libp2p-analytcs/issues).
- **Perform code reviews**.
- **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.

Small note: If editing the README, please conform to the [standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) specification.
